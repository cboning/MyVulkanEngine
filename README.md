# My Vulkan Engine

This is a game engine that I developed personally.


## Current features


- Model loading (configuration separation)
- Rendering process configuration is separated from the program (configuration is stored in a JSON file and read during runtime to avoid frequent compilation)
- Text system and rendering
- Resource manager

## Unfinished features
- Sound playback manager
- Physics system
- More rendering effects
- Separation of game content calculation and rendering
- Etc.
